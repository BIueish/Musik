<h1>Musik</h1>
A simple command line music player for Windows, Mac and Linux.

<h3>Features</h3>
- Play MP3, WAV or OGG music files
- Quickly access songs if needed by an index rather than name
- Create and edit custom albums
- Superfast song loading and playing
- And other standard features...

<h3>Running</h3>
As of now, Musik is only available as source code, and you'll need Python 3 to run it.\
The only dependency is pygame.
Simply download ```musik.py``` and then install the pygame library using `python3
-m pip install pygame-ce` or just `pip3 install pygame-ce`

Musik can then be run by Python normally.
